<h3>About us:</h3>
<p>We are a small, very selective group of movie buffs who meet every Friday to watch a feature lenght documentary, U.S independent movies, foreign films and old classic movies. At the end of every presentation, we have a lively debate on the goods and bads of this film. You can send an email to the director of this club to be accepted in it. You'll have to take two tests to be accepted. A written one to test your knowledge of film genres and a oral one to find out if your taste in movies is good enough for us.</p>
